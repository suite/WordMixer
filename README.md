# WordMixer
Keep the first and last letter, mixes the rest!

Notes:
While making this, I didn't think it would be the hard. Infact, I got a majority of it done rather quickly. However, I ran into a troubling bug that bit at me for a while. The bug occured everytime a word would end in a punctuation. Luckily, it's all up and working now.
